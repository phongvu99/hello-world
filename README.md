# Hello-world
Hello World!
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
Hi everyone, my name is Phong and this is my first time using GitHub.
I'm a newbie at heart and are currently learning Python and C.
I'm mostly interested in software and game development.
You can find my first work at Scratch ( a code learning platform for kid, yeah I know, we all have to start somewhere).
Computer is a wonderful invention and the things that it could do is unbelievable.
That's why I have chosen Computer Programming to be my main specialty.
I hope to learn from every one, to be the best version of myself, and you could learn from me too :)
Thanks!
And have a good day!
